# Project Name: College Majors Salary Analysis

This project is a practice exercise to demonstrate the usage of the pandas Python library for data analysis. The objective is to read and compare data related to college majors and their corresponding salaries. The project focuses on analyzing the risk and potential associated with different majors in terms of their salaries.

## Introduction

In this project, we utilize the pandas library, a powerful data manipulation tool, to explore and analyze data on college majors and their salaries. The primary goal is to compare the salaries of different majors and evaluate the risk and potential associated with each major's salary.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- pandas library
- Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```
pip install pandas
```

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the prerequisites mentioned above.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python IDE.
4. Navigate to the project directory.
5. Open the notebook file (`pandas_exploration.ipynb`).

## Data

The data used for this project is sourced from a reliable dataset related to college majors and salaries. The dataset includes information such as major category, median salary, and other relevant attributes.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
Bambu00/
  ├── pandas_exploration.ipynb
  ├── college_majors.csv
  └── README.md
```

- `pandas_exploration.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code and analysis.
- `college_majors.csv`: CSV file containing the college majors and salary data.
## Examples

Here are a few examples of the analysis performed in this project:

- Compare the median salaries of different majors.
- Calculate the average salary for each major category.
- Determine the majors with the highest and lowest salaries.
- Identify the majors with the highest potential (based on salary growth over time).
- Analyze the relationship between major popularity and salary.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook (`pandas_exploration.ipynb`) to see the complete analysis and code examples.
